The speed data “Lynn_SpeedData.csv” contains the following date: May 2015 - October 2016 except for August 2015 due to bad data.

Two ways to solve this problem:
1. Only use one year data, Nov.2015 - Oct.2016, and replicate across time.
OR
2. Use whatever we have, and for the months that are missing, replicate from Nov.2015 - Oct.2016’s monthly data.
